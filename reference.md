- Pseudocode is the set of instructions for an algorithm written in a plain language.
- Boolean algebra uses mathematical expressions that are evaluated to one of two values: TRUE or FALSE.
- Control statments allow you to have flexible outcomes by selecting which pieces of codes are executed, or not.
- Sequential statmenetes are executed in the default ordering.
- Iterative statements allow you to execute the same piece of code a specified number of times, or until a condition is reached.
- Conditional statements are used in programming to handle descisions, and they have two parts: hypothesis (if) and conclusion (then).
