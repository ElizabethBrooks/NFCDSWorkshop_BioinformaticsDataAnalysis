# NFCDS Workshop - Bioinformatics Data Analysis

## Website
https://elizabethbrooks.github.io/NFCDSWorkshop_BioinformaticsDataAnalysis/

## Description
This is the first lesson in a two-part workshop series Programming and Data Analysis with R and BASH, which is delivered as part of the NFCDS pedagogdy fellowship program.

Given the increasing amount of data being generated today, programmatic data analysis is an important skill for a wide range of fields. The R programming language and Unix/Linux command line can be powerful tools for analyzing data on their own. More powerfully, the huge variety of R and command line tools can be used together with scripting to create custom pipelines to analyze large or complex data sets.

## Outcomes
As a hands-on workshop participants will learn what R and Unix/Linux command line tools are available for processing different types of data sets. This workshop begins with a walkthrough of essential programming and scripting techniques. Also included is an introduction to best practices in both programming and data analysis.

## Audience
This workshop is designed for anyone interested in learning more about programming best practices, and how to create R and BASH scripts to automate data analysis. These lessons will help you to learn the fundamental concepts necessary to understand coding, programming, and the basics of the R and BASH programming languages as a beginner.

No prior programming or data analysis experience is required.
