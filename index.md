Data analysis is an important skill for a wide range of fields, particularly in the sciences. There is also an increasing amount of data being generated today, which requires some proficiency in programming in order to be efficiently processed. The R programming language and Unix/Linux command line can be powerful tools for data analysis on their own. More powerfully, the huge variety of R and command line tools can be used together with scripting to create custom pipelines.

## Audience
This workshop is designed for anyone interested in learning more about programming best practices and how to create R and BASH scripts to automate data analysis. For example, biologists interested in learning how to create pipelines that use a combination of R scripts to analyze and visualize data. Another potential application of the skills learned from this workshop is the ability to create a set of scripts that work together to integrate specific omics tools in the data analysis workflow.

## Outcomes
As a hands-on workshop participants will learn what R and Unix/Linux command line tools are available for processing different types of data sets. Additionally, participants will explore how to create custom scripts to automate the analysis of large data sets. This workshop would include an introduction to scripting with a focus on best practices in both programming and data analysis. Comparative techniques for creating simple, modular scripts in both R and BASH will be emphasized.

> ## Prerequisites
>
> Participants should be comfortable with using a computer and basic statistical methods. Furthermore, participants should have:
> - used a computer before
> - limited to no experience with BASH
> - limited to no experience with R
