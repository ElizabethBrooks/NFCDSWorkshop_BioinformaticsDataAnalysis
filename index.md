Data analysis is an important skill for a wide range of fields, particularly in the sciences. There is also an increasing amount of data being generated today, which requires some proficiency in programming in order to be efficiently processed. The R programming language and Unix/Linux command line can be powerful tools for data analysis on their own. More powerfully, the huge variety of R and command line tools can be used together with scripting to create custom pipelines.

This workshop is designed for anyone interested in learning more about programming best practices and how to create R and BASH scripts to automate data analysis. For example, biologists interested in learning how to create pipelines that use a combination of R scripts to analyze and visualize data. Another potential application of the skills learned from this workshop is the ability to create a set of scripts that work together to integrate specific omics tools in the data analysis workflow.
