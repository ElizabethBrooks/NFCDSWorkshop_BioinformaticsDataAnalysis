Data analysis is an important skill for a wide range of fields, particularly in the sciences. There is also an increasing amount of data being generated today, which requires some proficiency in programming in order to be efficiently processed. The R programming language and Unix/Linux command line have powerful tools for data analysis that can be used in many cases interchangeably. More powerfully, the huge variety of R and command line tools can be used together with scripting to create custom scalable pipelines.

This workshop is designed for anyone interested in learning more about programming best practices and creating scripts to automate data analysis. For example, biologists interested in learning how to create pipelines that use other scripts or specific omics tools for analyzing/visualizing data.
